# MATLAB-SIMULATION-FOR-PWM-INVERTERS-IN-POWER-ELECTRONICS
*This is a part of my annual semester project on my elective Power Electronics (subject code : IC034), Department of Instrumentation and Control Engineering. NIT Trichy*

---

- I was a very difficult task to accomplish as there was not a **single** place in the web where I could find the complete explanation about the circuits.
- However, it is the internet after all. I found the information scattered all over the internet around hundreds of websites, images and videos.
- I consolidated all of them into one place and made a report on **PWM inverters in Power Electronics**
- Please notify me if you have any problem simulating them. I am using MATLAB2013a.
